# Earthquake_prediction
This Project is about Predicting the Possibility and Magnitude of upcoming Earthquake using some Machine Learning models like CNN.
In first phase of this project we are performing  data visualization, EDA(Exploratory data analysis ), Feature engineering, Data normalization etc.
